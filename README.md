# YURegistration Bot
Puppeteer Based Script to Automate Yeshiva University Registration


Copyright (c) 2020
Registration Bot for students in Yeshiva University's MYP Program

Uses Puppeteer, Readline and OS to determine
correct Chrome Path and run registration script.

Current version runs with just puppteer, but executables can be
generated using local Google Chrome installation as a dependency.

This has been tested to remain functional if run
one hour prior to use time and will execute registration
in ~4 seconds (GUI) or ~2 seconds (Headless)

Customizable by user, but requires admin input the correct
registration time

This bot can be customized to perform on any banner system
and is being ported for use in STERN, IBC, BMP and JSS
